h1. YaYAML

Yet another YAML parser for .Net

h2. What is YaYAML?

A YAML parser for .Net. It's currently very under-featured, and is really just handles parsing of hashes and lists.

h3. Why have you bothered with this?

I needed a simple file format for hash data, and I didn't want to use XML. I could've implemented my own simple format, but I thought YAML would work nicely.
