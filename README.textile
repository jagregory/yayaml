h1. YaYAML

Yet another YAML parser for .Net

h2. What is YaYAML?

A YAML parser for .Net. It's currently very under-featured, and is really just handles parsing of hashes and lists.

h3. Why have you bothered with this?

I needed a simple file format for hash data, and I didn't want to use XML. I could've implemented my own simple format, but I thought YAML would work nicely.

h2. How do I use it?

 # Download the source and build it
 # Reference it
 # Use as so:

<pre>
var yaml = new Yaml();
var document = yaml.ParseFile("my file name.yaml");
</pre>
